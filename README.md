# Text-Classification-Movies-Review-Using-TensorFlow
This project is an implementation of text classification using TensorFlow, based on the tutorial by [Tech With Tim]([link-to-the-tutoria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-_pWoy2fb4&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-lak7tiFDec5_ZMItiIIfmj&index=5)). It demonstrates the process of training a text classifier model to categorize text data into predefined classes or labels.For testing purpose I have used different data which i have provide as text1.txt file.
